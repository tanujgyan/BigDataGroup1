Brute Force :

MapReduce program written in java but unable to run all 760 features .However tested on small data set and it is working.
Also when trying to test accuracy task size is exceeding the maximum size .

Forward and Backward Algorithm :

MapReduce for these are written in Python.
Here also small data set can be tested for accuracy but however for the whole data set we are unable to find accuracy because of memory issues.
